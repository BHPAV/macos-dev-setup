## Development
visual-studio-code      # Primary code editor with excellent Neo4j and Python support
iterm2                  # Terminal emulator with advanced features (install via Homebrew)
homebrew                # Package manager for automated setup
neo4j-desktop           # Local graph database development and testing
docker                  # Container management (or Colima+Docker-CLI for lighter alternative)
insomnia                # API testing with GraphQL support
tableplus               # Fast, SQLite-friendly database GUI
git                     # Version control
github-cli              # GitHub command line interface

## Window Management
rectangle               # MIT-licensed window manager without telemetry

# Quality-of-Life Utilities (Install as Needed)

## System Utilities
alfred                  # Advanced Spotlight replacement with workflows (optional Powerpack)
bartender              # Menu bar management for cleaner UI
amphetamine            # Prevent sleep mode
appcleaner             # Clean app uninstallation
istat-menus            # System monitoring and stats
cleanshot-x            # Enhanced screenshot and recording tools
vlc                    # Universal media player

# Development Stack Additions

## Database Tools
dbeaver-lite           # Universal database GUI for multiple databases
neo4j-bloom            # Visual exploration for Neo4j
tableplus-cli          # CLI companion for TablePlus

## Development Environment
asdf                   # Version manager for multiple languages
pyenv                  # Python version management
direnv                 # Project-specific environment variables
make                   # Build automation

# Notes
# 1. Install core workflow tools on Day 1
# 2. Add quality-of-life utilities only when specific needs arise
# 3. Use Homebrew Bundle (Brewfile) for automated setup
# 4. Skip duplicate tools in each category to maintain a lean system
# 5. Avoid installing multiple tools that serve the same purpose
